# tec-Minstrel-4th
Upon the closing of the Tynemouth Software store on Tindie.com and remaining Minstrel 4th's sold on Thefuturewas8bit.com, documentation also disappeared. This is a backup source for those who put their 4th away for a rainy day. Many thanks to Steve Justin for preserving this resource!
